Welcome to Saasio! This guide will get you from zero to your first project in under five minutes. We'll walk through creating your account and launching your first application.

Let's begin.

## Part 1: Create Your Account

Your Saasio account is your personal workspace.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up on the Homepage">
    Navigate to [**Saasio.io**](https://saasio.io) and click the **Sign Up** button. You will need to provide your email address and a secure password.
  </Step>

<Step title="Verify Your Email">
  Check your inbox for a verification email. Click the link inside to confirm
  your account and protect its security. If you don't see it, check your spam
  folder.
</Step>

  <Step title="Log In">
    Once verified, log in with your new credentials. You will be directed to your main **Projects Dashboard**, which is the central hub for all your applications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Part 2: Create Your First Project

A **Project** in Saasio is a complete, standalone SaaS application. It comes with its own database, pages, and backend logic.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a New Project">
    On your Projects Dashboard, click the **"Create Project"** button. This will open the project setup screen.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Your Project Details">
    You will be asked for three key details:

    - **Project Name:** A public name for your app (e.g., "AI Content Writer").
    - **Project Subdomain:** A unique URL for your app (e.g., `ai-writer.saasio.io`).
    - **Description:** A short, internal summary of your project.

        alt="Create Project Modal in Saasio"
        src="/images/quickstart/create-project-modal.png"
        style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch the Editor">
    Click **Create Project**. Your project will be set up instantly, and you'll be taken directly into the Saasio Visual Editor.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Congratulations! You are now inside your first project and ready to start building.
