Forms are the primary way you'll collect information from your users. In this tutorial, we'll build a complete contact form that includes real-time validation to ensure the data is correct before it's submitted.

We will cover:

1.  **Creating a Zod Schema** to define our data rules.
2.  **Building the Form UI** with input fields and a submit button.
3.  **Linking the Form** to our Zod Schema.
4.  **Creating a Workflow** to handle the submission and show feedback.

## Part 1: Define the Rules with a Zod Schema

First, we need to create the "rulebook" for our form data.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to Zod Schemas">
Go to the **Data** tab in the top navigation bar, then select the **"Zod Schemas"** sub-tab.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Create the Schema">
  Create a new schema and name it `ContactFormSchema`.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Add and Configure Fields">
Add the following fields and validation rules to your schema. This will define the structure and requirements for our form.

| Field Name | Data Type | Key Validation Rules         | Error Message Example                 |
| :--------- | :-------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `name`     | `Text`    | Required, Minimum length: 2  | "Name must be at least 2 characters." |
| `email`    | `Email`   | Required                     | "Please enter a valid email address." |
| `message`  | `Text`    | Required, Minimum length: 10 | "Message must be 10+ characters."     |

</Step>
</Steps>

## Part 2: Build the Form UI

Now, let's create the visual form on our page.

1.  **Add a Form Element:** From the **Elements** tab, drag a **Form** element onto your canvas. This will act as the container for our inputs.
2.  **Add Input Fields and Error Text:** For each field in our schema (`name`, `email`, `message`), you will add two elements _inside_ the Form container:
    - An **Input** element where the user will type.
    - A **Text** element placed directly below the input. This is where the validation error message will appear. You can style it to be red to make it stand out.
3.  **Add a Submit Button:** Drag a **Button** _inside_ the Form container. In its properties, set its **`type`** to **`Submit`**. This is a special type that tells the button to trigger the form's own workflow.
4.  **Add a Text Element for Feedback:** Place a Text element somewhere near the form. We will use this to show a "Thank you!" message.

## Part 3: Link the Form to the Schema

This is the magic step where we connect our UI to our rules.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Select the Form Element">
Click on the main **Form** element on your canvas (the container).
</Step>

<Step title="2. Link the Schema">
  In the **Properties Panel** on the right, find the property for **`Schema`**.
  Click the dropdown and select your newly created `ContactFormSchema`.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Link Each Input and Error Text">
Now, we need to tell the form how each input and error message corresponds to a rule in our schema.

- **For the "Name" Input:**

  1.  Select the `name` **Input** element. In its properties, set the **`Name`** to `name`.
  2.  Select the `name` **Text** element below it. In its properties, find the **`Form error message`** and select the `name` field from the schema.

- **For the "Email" Input:**

  1.  Select the `email` **Input** element and set its **`Name`** to `email`.
  2.  Select the `email` **Text** element and set its **`Form error message`** to the `email` field.

- **For the "Message" Input:** 1. Select the `message` **Input** element and set its **`Name`** to `message`. 2. Select the `message` **Text** element and set its **`Form error message`** to the `message` field.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Part 4: Create the Submission Workflow

Finally, we need to tell the form what to do when the user clicks the "Submit" button or press the "Enter" key and the data is valid.

1.  **Select the Form Element:** Select the main **Form** container again.
2.  **Open the Logic Tab:** Go to the **Logic** tab in the top navigation bar. Because it's a form, it has a special trigger called **"On Submit"**. This workflow will _only_ run if all the data passes the schema's validation rules.
3.  **Add Your Actions:** In the "On Submit" workflow, you can now add the actions to process the valid data. For this tutorial, let's do two things:
    - Add a **"Create new data"** action to save the form's data to a `Submissions` Data Table. You can access the form's data using the `Data Submitted from Form` variable.
    - Add a **"Show / Hide element"** action to display the "Thank you!" message you created earlier.

Now you have a fully functional and validated form! When a user fills it out, they will get instant feedback if they make a mistake, and the data will only be processed once everything is correct.
