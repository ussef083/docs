You've learned how to read and display data (the "R" in C.R.U.D.). Now it's time to master the other three essential operations: **Create, Update, and Delete**.

In this tutorial, we will build a complete management system for our blog posts, allowing us to add new posts, edit existing ones, and remove them.

---

## Prerequisites

This tutorial builds directly on the previous two. You must have already completed:

1.  **"Displaying a Dynamic List of Data"**: You need a page showing a list of all your posts.
2.  **"Displaying Single Record Details"**: You need a `post-detail` page that can load a single post based on a URL parameter.

## Part 1: CREATE - Building a "New Post" Form

First, let's create a way to add new posts to our database.

#### **Create the Zod Schema**

Before we build the forms, let's create a single "rulebook" for our post data. This ensures that new posts and edited posts follow the same validation rules.

- Go to **Data â†’ Zod Schemas**.
- Create a new schema named `PostSchema`.
- Add the following two fields:

| Field Name | Data Type | Key Validation Rules         |
| :--------- | :-------- | :--------------------------- |
| `title`    | `Text`    | Required, Minimum length: 5  |
| `content`  | `Text`    | Required, Minimum length: 20 |

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Create the 'New Post' Page and Form">
- Create a new page named `new-post`.
- Add a **Form** element to the canvas.
- Inside the form:
  - Add an **Input** element. In its properties, set its **Name** to `title`.
  - Add another **Input** (or a Text Area) and set its **Name** to `content`.
  - Add a **Submit Button** labeled "Create Post".
- **Crucially, select the main Form element and in its Properties Panel, link its `Schema` to your `PostSchema`**. This automatically enables validation.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Build the 'On Submit' Workflow">
  - Select the **Form** element and open its **"On Submit"** workflow from the
  **Logic** tab. - Add the **"Create new data"** action.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Configure the Action">

- **Target Table:** Select your `Posts` Data Table.
- **Fields to Create:** We need to map our form inputs to the database columns.
  - For the `title` field, bind its value to the `Data submitted from form`'s `title` property.
  - For the `content` field, bind its value to the `Data submitted from form`'s `content` property.

</Step>

<Step title="4. Navigate After Creation">
- After the "Create new data" action, add a **"Go to page..."** action.
- Set the destination to your main blog list page. This way, the user sees their newly created post in the list immediately after creating it.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Part 2: UPDATE - Building an "Edit Post" Form

Next, let's allow users to edit a post on the `post-detail` page.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Add the Editing Form to the Detail Page">
- Go to your `post-detail` page.
- Add a **Form** element. **Link its `Schema` to your `PostSchema`**.
- Inside the form, add two **Input** elements.
  - Set the first input's **Name** to `title`.
  - Set the second input's **Name** to `content`.
- **Pre-fill the form:** Bind the *default value* of each input to the `currentPost` state.
  - Bind the title input's value to `currentPost.title`.
  - Bind the content input's value to `currentPost.content`.
- Add a **Submit Button** inside the form labeled "Save Changes".
</Step>

<Step title="2. Build the 'Save Changes' Workflow">

- Select the "Save Changes" button and open its **"On Click"** workflow.
- Add the **"Update existing data"** action.

</Step>

<Step title="3. Configure the Update Action">

- **Target Table:** Select your `Posts` Data Table.
- **Conditions (WHERE Clause):** Tell Saasio _which_ post to update. Add a condition where `_id` is equal to the `currentPost._id`.
- **Fields to Update:** Map the database columns to the _current values from the form_.
  - Set the `title` field to the `Data submitted from form`'s `title` property.
  - Set the `content` field to the `Data submitted from form`'s `content` property.

</Step>

<Step title="4. Provide User Feedback">
- After the update action, add a **"Show toast message"** action with a `Success` type and a message like "Post updated successfully!".
</Step>
</Steps>

## Part 3: DELETE - Adding a "Delete Post" Button

Finally, let's add the ability to remove a post.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Add a Delete Button">
- On your `post-detail` page, add a new **Button** labeled "Delete Post". It's good practice to style it differently (e.g., with a red color) to indicate a destructive action.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Build the 'Delete' Workflow">
  - Select the "Delete Post" button and open its **"On Click"** workflow. - Add
  the **"Delete data"** action.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Configure the Delete Action">
  - **Target Table:** Select your `Posts` Data Table. - **Conditions (WHERE
  Clause):** This is the most important step. You must specify which post to
  delete. Add a condition where `_id` is equal to the `_id` of the `currentPost`
  state variable.
  <Warning>
    Never leave the conditions empty on a Delete action, as this would delete
    **all posts** in your table.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="4. Navigate After Deletion">
- After a post is deleted, the detail page is no longer valid. You must redirect the user.
- Add a **"Go to page..."** action and send the user back to your main blog list page.
</Step>
</Steps>

Congratulations! You have now implemented the full suite of CRUD operations. Your users can create, read, update, and delete data, forming the core of a fully functional web application.
