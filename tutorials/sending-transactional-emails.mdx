Automated emails are essential for communicating with your users. Whether you're welcoming a new user, confirming an order, or resetting a password, these "transactional" emails are a core part of any application.

In this tutorial, we will build a workflow that automatically sends a "Welcome!" email to a user immediately after they sign up.

We will cover:

1.  **Creating a dynamic Email Template** with personalized content.
2.  **Building a secure, server-side Function** to handle the email sending.
3.  **Triggering the Function** from our existing Sign-Up workflow.

## Part 1: Create a Dynamic Email Template

First, we need to design the email itself. We'll create a template that can be personalized with the new user's name.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to Email Templates">
In the **Left Panel** of the Visual Editor, navigate to the **Email Templates** tab.

</Step>

<Step title="2. Create a New Template">
- Click to create a new template and give it a name, like `WelcomeEmail`.
- You will be taken to an editor where you can design your email's subject and body.

</Step>

<Step title="3. Add Dynamic Content">
This is the key step. We need to define "placeholders" for the data that will be different for each user.
- **Subject:** Set the subject to something like `Welcome to Our App, <name>!`
- **Body:** In the body of the email, you can write your welcome message. Where you want to display the user's name, use the same placeholder syntax: `Hi <name>, we're so glad you've joined.`

The `<name>` is a **variable**. We will provide a value for this variable when we send the email.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Part 2: Build a Secure "Send Welcome Email" Function

Sending emails must be done on the server. A **Server-side Function** is the perfect, reusable tool for this job.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Create the Server Function">
- Go to **Data â†’ Functions**.
- Create a new **Server-side** Function and name it `SendWelcomeEmail`.

</Step>

<Step title="2. Define the Function's Props (Inputs)">
Our function needs to know *who* to send the email to and *what name* to use for personalization. Add two **Props**:
- `userEmail` (Data Type: `Text`)
- `userName` (Data Type: `Text`)

</Step>

<Step title="3. Build the Function's Workflow">
- Open the workflow editor for your `SendWelcomeEmail` function.
- Add the **"Send Email"** action.

</Step>

<Step title="4. Configure the 'Send Email' Action">
- **Template:** Select your `WelcomeEmail` template from the dropdown.
- **Send To:** Bind this to the `userEmail` **Prop** of your function.
- **Display Name:** Enter the "From" name for your app (e.g., "The Saasio Team").
- **Preview (Dynamic Data):** This is where we provide the values for our placeholders.
  - The **key** must match the variable name in your template (`name`).
  - The **value** should be bound to the `userName` **Prop** of your function.

</Step>
</Steps>

Your secure, reusable function is now ready. It accepts an email and a name, and sends your beautifully designed welcome email.

## Part 3: Trigger the Function After Sign-Up

The final step is to call our new function from our existing user registration workflow.

1.  **Navigate to your `signup` page.**
2.  Select the **Sign-Up Form** and open its **"On Submit"** workflow from the **Logic** tab.
3.  **Find the successful sign-up path.** Your workflow should have a **"Sign up and Login"** action. This action returns the newly created user object.
4.  **Add the "Trigger Function" action** immediately after the "Sign up and Login" action.
    - **Function:** Select your `SendWelcomeEmail` function.
    - **Props:**
      - `userEmail`: Bind this to the `email` from the **Result** of the "Sign up and Login" action.
      - `userName`: Bind this to the `name` from the **Result** of the "Sign up and Login" action.

<Info>
  By placing this in the same workflow, the welcome email is sent instantly and
  automatically the moment a new user successfully creates their account.
</Info>

You have now built a complete transactional email system, a critical feature for user onboarding and engagement in any SaaS application. You can reuse your `SendWelcomeEmail` function anywhere you need it.
