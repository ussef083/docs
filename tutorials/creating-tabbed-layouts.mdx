Tabbed layouts are a fantastic way to organize content on a single page, such as a user's "Settings" or "Profile" page. Instead of showing everything at once, you can break it down into logical sections, and the user can switch between them without reloading the page.

In this tutorial, we will build a simple three-tab interface ("Profile", "Billing", and "Security"). This is a perfect exercise for mastering **local state** and **conditions**.

---

## Part 1: Set Up the State

The entire tab system is controlled by a single state variable that keeps track of which tab is currently active.

1.  **Navigate to your page** (e.g., a new `settings` page).
2.  Select the `Page body` and go to the **States** tab.
3.  Create a new state variable:
    - **Name:** `activeTab`
    - **Data Type:** `Text`
    - **Default Value:** `profile` (This will be the tab that is visible when the page first loads).

## Part 2: Build the UI

Our UI will have two main parts: the tab buttons that the user clicks, and the content panels that are shown or hidden.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Create the Tab Buttons">
- Add three **Button** or **Text** elements to your page. Label them "Profile", "Billing", and "Security". These will be our clickable tabs.

</Step>

<Step title="2. Create the Content Panels">
- Below the tab buttons, add three **Container** elements.
- **Inside the first container:** Add some text or inputs related to "Profile".
- **Inside the second container:** Add content related to "Billing".
- **Inside the third container:** Add content related to "Security".

Each container is a "panel" that corresponds to one of our tabs.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Part 3: Create the Workflows

Now, we need to create the logic that updates our `activeTab` state when a user clicks a button.

- **For the "Profile" Button:**
  - Create an **"On Click"** workflow.
  - Add a **"Set data in state"** action.
  - **Target State:** `activeTab`.
  - **New Value:** Set it to the static text `profile`.
- **For the "Billing" Button:**
  - Create an **"On Click"** workflow.
  - Add a **"Set data in state"** action that sets `activeTab` to `billing`.
- **For the "Security" Button:**
  - Create an **"On Click"** workflow.
  - Add a **"Set data in state"** action that sets `activeTab` to `security`.

Now, whenever a user clicks a button, our `activeTab` state will update to reflect their choice.

---

## Part 4: Conditionally Show the Content Panels

This is the final step where we connect the state to the UI's visibility. We will use conditions to show only the panel that matches the active tab.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Configure the 'Profile' Panel">
- Select the **Container** for the "Profile" content.
- Go to the **Conditions** tab in the **Left Panel**.
- Add a new condition:
  - **Condition Logic:** Check if the `activeTab` state variable `is not equal to` `profile`.
  - **Style Change:** In the `styles` section, set the `display` property to `none`.

</Step>

<Step title="2. Configure the 'Billing' and 'Security' Panels">
- Repeat the process for the other two panels:
  - For the **Billing Container**, add a condition to hide it (`display: none`) if `activeTab` is not equal to `billing`.
  - For the **Security Container**, add a condition to hide it (`display: none`) if `activeTab` is not equal to `security`.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **How it Works:** By default, all three panels will try to be visible. Our
  conditions act as "hiding rules". The "Profile" panel will only be hidden if
  the active tab *isn't* "profile"â€”meaning it will be visible only when it *is*
  "profile".
</Info>

## Bonus: Styling the Active Tab

To give the user better visual feedback, you can also use conditions to change the style of the currently active tab button.

- Select the "Profile" button.
- Go to its **Conditions** tab.
- Add a condition: IF `activeTab` is equal to `profile`, THEN change its `backgroundColor` or `font-weight`.
- Repeat for the "Billing" and "Security" buttons.

You have now built a clean, fully functional tabbed interface, a common and essential component of modern web applications.
