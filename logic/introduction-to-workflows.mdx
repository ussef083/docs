# Introduction to Workflows

You've designed a beautiful user interface. Now, it's time to make it work. Workflows are the engine of your application—they are the logic that runs when a user interacts with your UI.

Whether you're submitting a form, navigating to a new page, or fetching data from an API, everything is handled by a workflow.

## The Core Concepts

Every workflow in Saasio is built on three simple concepts:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="The Trigger" icon="bolt">
    This is the event that starts the workflow. Most commonly, it's a user
    interaction, like **clicking a button**, **submitting a form**, or a **page
    finishing loading**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="An Action" icon="play">
    An action is a single, specific operation. It's one step in your workflow,
    such as **"Go to page"**, **"Create new data"**, or **"Set data in state"**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="A Workflow" icon="list-ol">
    A workflow is simply a sequence of one or more actions that are executed in
    order when a trigger occurs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Building Your First Workflow: Page Navigation

Let's create the most common workflow: making a button navigate to another page when clicked.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Select the Trigger Element">
On the canvas, select the element that will trigger the workflow. In this case, it's our **Button** element. A selected element will have a blue outline.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Open the Logic Tab">
  With the button selected, click on the **Logic** tab in the top navigation
  bar. This opens the workflow editor for the selected element's default trigger
  (for a button, the trigger is "On Click").
</Step>

<Step title="3. Choose and Configure the Action">
We want to navigate, so:
- Open the **Navigation** category.
- Select the **"Go to page..."** action.
- A configuration panel will appear. In the `Select a page` field, select your desired destination page from the dropdown.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Frame caption="Configuring a 'Go to page' action in the Logic tab.">
  <img
    alt="Configuring a 'Go to page' action in the Logic tab."
    src="/images/go-to-page-action.png"
  />
</Frame>

**That's it!** Now, when a user clicks that button in your live application, the "Go to page" action will run, and they will be redirected. You can continue to add more actions to this workflow to create more complex sequences.
