Actions are the individual steps that make up your application's workflows. Each action is designed to run in a specific context: on the user's browser (**Frontend**) or on the Saasio backend (**Server**). Understanding this is key to building powerful logic.

---

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Navigation Actions" icon="compass">
  These actions control the user's browser and run entirely on the **Frontend**.

  <Card title="Go to page..." icon="arrow-right">
    **Purpose:** Redirects the user to another internal page, with the option to pass data through URL parameters.
    
    **Key Parameters:**
    - `Destination Page`: Select the page you want to send the user to from a dropdown list.
    - `URL Parameters` (Optional): Define key-value pairs to send to the destination page. This is essential for creating dynamic pages, like loading a specific user's profile (`/profile?id=123`)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Go to external website" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
    **Purpose:** Redirects the user to an external URL outside of your application.
    
    **Key Parameters:**
    - `URL`: The full external website address.
    - `Open In`: Choose whether to open in a `"new"` tab or the `"same"` tab.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refresh the page" icon="rotate-right">
    **Purpose:** Reloads the current page, equivalent to the browser's refresh button.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Return to previous page" icon="arrow-left">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Move to next page" icon="forward">
    **Purpose:** Navigates the user forward to the next page in their browser's history stack.
  </Card>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data & Database Actions" icon="database">
  These actions interact with your project's data stores. They can be triggered from the **Frontend** or **Server** but the core logic is always executed securely on the **Server**.

  <Card title="Create new data" icon="plus">
    **Purpose:** Adds a new row of data to a specified Data Table. This is the primary way to save new information, such as a new user signing up or a user creating a new post.
    
    ---

    #### **Configuration Steps**
    1.  **Select Target Table:** Choose the Data Table where the new record should be created (e.g., `Users`).
    2.  **Define Fields to Create:** Map each column in your table to the value you want to store. The value can be static (e.g., a fixed string) or dynamic (e.g., the input from a form field).

    ---

    #### **Handling the Response**
    This is an asynchronous action. Use state variables to manage the result in your UI:
    -   **Result:** Select a state variable to store the newly created row, including its unique `id` and timestamps. The state's data type **must** match the Data Table (e.g., `Users`).
    -   **Error:** Select a `Text (string)` state variable to hold any error messages if the creation fails.
    -   **Is Loading:** Select a `Boolean` state variable that is `true` while the action is in progress.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Update existing data" icon="pencil">
    **Purpose:** Modifies one or more existing rows in a Data Table based on specific criteria. Use this for actions like saving changes to a user's profile.
    
    ---

    #### **Configuration Steps**
    1.  **Select Target Table:** Choose the Data Table you want to update (e.g., `Users`).
    2.  **Set Conditions (WHERE Clause):** Define the rules to find the specific row(s) to update. For example, "Find the user where 'ID' is equal to the current user's ID".
    3.  **Define Fields to Update:** Provide the new values for only the columns you want to change.

    ---

    #### **Handling the Response**
    -   **Result:** Select a state variable to store the updated row(s). **Note:** This action always returns a **list (array)** of records, even if only one row was updated. Your state variable must be configured as a `List` of the matching Data Table type.
    -   **Error:** Select a `Text (string)` state variable to hold any error messages.
    -   **Is Loading:** Select a `Boolean` state variable to track the update process.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Delete data" icon="trash">
    **Purpose:** Permanently removes one or more rows from a Data Table. This action is irreversible and should be used with caution.
    
    ---

    #### **Configuration Steps**
    1.  **Select Target Table:** Choose the Data Table to delete from.
    2.  **Set Conditions (WHERE Clause):** Define the rules to find the correct row(s) to delete.
    <Warning>
    If you leave the conditions empty, this action will **delete all rows** in the table.
    </Warning>

    ---

    #### **Handling the Response**
    -   **Result:** This action **does not return any data**. The rows are permanently deleted. You do not need to set a Result state.
    -   **Error:** Select a `Text (string)` state variable to hold any error messages if the deletion fails.
    -   **Is Loading:** Select a `Boolean` state variable to provide UI feedback while the deletion is in progress.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Run Redis command" icon="bolt">
    **Purpose:** Executes a command directly on your project's Redis instance for advanced caching and real-time features.
    
    ---

    #### **Configuration Steps**
    1.  **Select Data Type:** Choose the Redis data type you want to work with (`String`, `Hash`, `List`, `Set`, or `Json`).
    2.  **Select Redis Command:** A new dropdown will show commands specific to the selected data type (e.g., `Set`, `Get`).
    3.  **Provide Command Parameters:** Fill in the required inputs for the command, such as the `key` and `value`.

    ---

    #### **Handling the Response**
    -   **Result:** Select a state variable to store the output of the command. The state's data type must match the command's expected output.
    -   **Error:** Select a `Text (string)` state variable to hold any error messages.
    -   **Is Loading:** Select a `Boolean` state variable to track the command's progress.
