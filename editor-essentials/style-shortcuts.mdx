## Most Useful Style Shortcuts

Here is a reference guide to the most common and useful shortcuts available.

### 1. Width & Height Shortcuts

Quickly set the dimensions of your elements.

| Shortcut | CSS Property Applied   | Description                                           |
| :------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `w+t`    | `width: fit-content;`  | Makes the element's width fit its content.            |
| `w+f`    | `width: 100%;`         | Makes the element take the full width of its parent.  |
| `h+t`    | `height: fit-content;` | Makes the element's height fit its content.           |
| `h+f`    | `height: 100%;`        | Makes the element take the full height of its parent. |

### 2. Margin & Padding Shortcuts

Apply consistent spacing to your elements. The number in the shortcut corresponds to the `rem` value.

| Shortcut | CSS Property Applied          |
| :------- | :---------------------------- |
| `m+a`    | `margin: auto;`               |
| `p+5`    | `padding: 5rem;`              |
| `m+10`   | `margin: 10rem;`              |
| _etc..._ | _(works for various numbers)_ |

Flexbox is the key to creating modern, responsive layouts. These shortcuts allow you to build complex flex containers in seconds.

| :------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `f+x`    | `display: flex;`           | The foundation for all flex layouts. |

| `f+c`    | `flex-direction: column;`  | Arranges items vertically.           |
| `j+c`    | `justify-content: center;` | Centers items along the main axis.   |

  your container and use three shortcuts in a row: `f+x`, `j+c`, and `i+c`.
