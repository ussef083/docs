Every application you build in Saasio is composed of two fundamental building blocks. Understanding the distinct role of each is the key to creating a powerful, full-stack application.

    Pages are what your users see and interact with—like a homepage, a

    API Routes are the invisible **backend**. They are server-side endpoints

## Pages: Building Your User Interface

Your project's pages form the map of your application. When you create a new project, Saasio automatically includes two essential, non-deletable pages:

- **Home (`/`):** The default page users land on when they visit your main URL.
- **404 (`/404`):** The "Not Found" page shown when a user tries to access a URL that doesn't exist.

Here’s the step-by-step process for adding new pages to your application.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to the Pages Tab">
In the left panel of the Visual Editor, ensure the **Pages** tab is selected. This area lists all the pages in your project.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Create a New Page">
  Click the **`+`** icon at the top of the pages list. This action opens a
  prompt to name your new page.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Enter the Page Name">
Provide a clear, simple name for your page. This name will automatically become its URL path. For example:
- A page named `pricing` will be accessible at `your-domain.com/pricing`.
- A page named `about-us` will be accessible at `your-domain.com/about-us`.

<Note>
  Once created, you can click on any page in the list to load it onto the
  central canvas and begin designing its layout and content.

## API Routes: Powering Your Backend

API Routes are your application's connection to the server. They are essential for any task that requires secure or private logic, such as fetching user data, processing a payment, or connecting to another company's API.

Here's how to create one.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to the API Routes Tab">
In the left panel, switch from "Pages" to the **API Routes** tab.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Create a New API Route">
  Click the **`+`** icon to open the API route configuration dialog.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Define the Route Path and Method">
Every API route needs two critical pieces of information:

- **Path Name:** The unique URL for your endpoint (e.g., `/users`, `/products`). This is the address that your application (or other services) will call.
- **Method:** The HTTP method the route will respond to. This defines the type of action the route performs:
  - `GET`: **Retrieve Data.** Use this method to read or fetch information from your database or an external service.
  - `POST`: **Create New Data.** Use this method to add a new record to your database or send data to an external service.
  - `PUT`: **Update Existing Data.** Use this method to modify a record that already exists.
  - `DELETE`: **Remove Data.** Use this method to permanently remove a record from your database.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Building API Route Logic

After creating an API Route, you must define what it does. Select the new route, then click the **Logic** tab in the top navigation bar. This opens the workflow editor for that route.

<Warning>
**Critical Rule: Always End Your Workflow with "Route Send Response"**

An API route's only job is to receive a request and send a response. The **`Route send response`** action is how you send that response.

- Every possible path in your API route's workflow **must** end with this action.
- If you use a **Conditioner** action, both the "true" branch and the "false" branch **must** have their own `Route send response` action at the end.

Failure to do this will cause the request to time out and result in an error, as the client will never receive a response.

</Warning>
