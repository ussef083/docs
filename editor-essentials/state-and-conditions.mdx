# Working with State & Conditions

So far, you've learned how to build a beautiful, static interface. Now, it's time to make it intelligent and interactive. This is done using two core features: **State** and **Conditions**.

- **State:** Think of State as the temporary memory for your page. It's where you store data that can change, such as user input, loading indicators, or data fetched from an API.
- **Conditions:** Conditions allow your UI elements to react to changes in State. They follow a simple "IF-THEN" logic: IF a certain condition is true, THEN change an element's appearance or value.

Mastering these two concepts is the key to building a dynamic application instead of just a static website.

## Part 1: Storing Data with State

A "state variable" is a container for a piece of data. In Saasio, states are always attached to a specific context: either to a UI element on a **Page** or to the **API Route** itself.

### State on a Page

On a page, states are scoped to an element. This means you first select the element that will "own" the state, like a container or the main body of the page.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Select the Host Element">
First, select the element that will hold your state variable. For page-wide states, it's common practice to select the top-level **`Body`** element in the **Layers** panel.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Navigate to the States Tab">
  With the element selected, go to the left panel and click on the **States**
  tab. This will show a list of all state variables attached to that element.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Open the Create State Dialog">
Click the **`+`** icon to open the "Create State" dialog.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Configuring Your State Variable

After clicking the `+` icon, a dialog will appear. Here’s a breakdown of each field you need to configure:

<ParamField path="Name" type="string" required>
  A descriptive, user-friendly name for your variable (e.g., `isLoading` or
  `userList`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Type" type="string | Data Table | Option Set" required>
    The type of data this variable will hold. This can be:
  
- A **simple type** like `Text`, `Number`, or `Boolean`.
- A **Data Table** (e.g., `Users`) for storing complex objects.
- An **Option Set** for storing a value from a predefined list of choices.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Is List? (Array)" type="boolean">
  Defines if the state holds a single value or a list of values. This defaults
  to `false`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Default Value" type="any">
  The initial value when the page loads. This should match the data type (e.g.,
  `false` for a Boolean, or empty for a list).
</ParamField>

#### Configuration Examples

Here’s how you would configure two common types of state variables:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Example 1: Single Boolean State">
  This state holds a single `true` or `false` value, perfect for tracking a loading status.

- **Name:** `isLoading`
- **Data Type:** `Boolean`
- **Is List?:** `false` (or leave as default)
- **Default Value:** `false`

</Tab>

<Tab title="Example 2: List of Users State">
  This state holds a list (or array) of complex data from your `Users` table.

- **Name:** `userList`
- **Data Type:** Select `Users` from the Data Table dropdown.
- **Is List?:** `true`
- **Default Value:** (leave empty to start with an empty list)

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### State in an API Route

In an API Route, states are attached globally to the route itself, as there is no UI. The process is simpler:

1.  With your API Route open, navigate to the **States** tab in the left panel.
2.  Click the **`+`** icon and configure your state variable using the same properties described above.

<Frame caption="Creating a new boolean state variable named isLoading.">
  <img
    alt="Configuring a new boolean state variable named isLoading."
    src="/images/create-state.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />
</Frame>
*You have now created a piece of memory for your page or API route that can be updated
by workflows and used in your logic.*

## Part 2: Displaying State in Your UI (Data Binding)

You can "bind" an element's property to a state variable, so it always displays the current value.

For example, to display the value of a state variable in a text element:

1.  Select the **Text** element on your canvas.
2.  In the **Properties Panel** (right side), find the `textToDisplay` property.
3.  Change its value from "static text" to **"state"**.
4.  In the `elementDataSource` field that appears, select your desired state variable.

The text element will now dynamically display the current value of that state.

## Part 3: Using Conditions to React to State

Conditions allow elements to change their appearance or content when your state changes. Let's make a "Submit" button change its text to "Saving..." when our `isLoading` state is `true`.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Select the Target Element">
First, select the element you want to change. In this case, it's the **Text element** that is *inside* our button.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Open the Conditions Tab">
  In the **Left Panel**, navigate to the **Conditions** tab.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Add and Configure a Condition">
  Click the **`+`** icon to add a new condition. A configuration panel will appear. Here, you define a rule that checks if something is true, and then specify how the element should change in response.

#### 1. Define the Condition

First, you must define the logic. In the **`condition`** section, build a dynamic expression that results in a `true` or `false` value.

_Example: To track a loading state, you would select the `isLoading` state variable and add an operation to check if its value is equal to `true`._

#### 2. Configure the Changes (When the Condition is True)

Next, you specify how the element should look or what it should contain **only when the condition you just defined is true**.

{" "}

<Info>
  When the condition is `false`, the element automatically reverts to its
  original, default properties and styles. You do not need to define a "false"
  state.
</Info>

You can make two types of changes:

- **Change the Primary Value:**
  In the `properties` section, you can override the element's main content. For our text element, you would set the `values` property to the new text you want: "Saving...".

- **Change the Style:**
  In the `styles` section, you can add one or more CSS style overrides. For example, you could change the button's `backgroundColor` to a muted grey to show it's in a loading state.

</Step>

</Steps>

Now, whenever the `isLoading` state becomes `true`, the button's text will automatically change to "Saving...". When it becomes `false`, it will revert to its original state.

### What's Next?

You now know how to create a UI that dynamically reacts to data. The final step is to learn how to change that data through user interactions, like clicking a button. This is done with Workflows.
