# Adding & Managing Elements

Elements are the visual building blocks of your application. Every piece of text, every button, and every pre-built component is an element. Learning how to add, organize, and structure them is the key to creating a beautiful and functional UI.

## Where to Find Elements

In Saasio, you can add elements to your page from two primary sources in the top navigation bar:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Elements Tab" icon="shapes">
    This palette contains the fundamental building blocks for any UI: **Text**,
    **Containers**, **Images**, **Buttons**, **Forms**, and more. You'll use
    these for creating custom layouts and basic content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="UI Libraries Tab" icon="swatchbook">
    This tab gives you access to a rich collection of pre-built, professionally
    designed components from popular libraries like
    [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/), and
    [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/), etc. Use these to build modern
    interfaces quickly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Adding Elements to the Canvas

The primary way to build your UI is by dragging and dropping elements onto the central canvas.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Select an Element or Component">
Open either the **Elements** tab or the **UI Libraries** tab from the top navigation bar. Find the component you wish to add.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Drag and Drop onto the Canvas">
  Click and hold the element, drag it over the central canvas to your desired
  position, and release it. The new element will appear on your page.
</Step>

<Step title="3. View the New Element in Layers">
After adding an element, look at the **Layers** panel on the left. You will see your new component listed in the page's element hierarchy. The Layers panel is essential for understanding the structure of your page.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip title="Pro Tip: Use Keyboard Shortcuts">
  For faster building, you can use keyboard shortcuts to add common elements
  directly to your canvas. Press the key combination, and the element will be
  added instantly.

- `Alt + C` : Container
- `Alt + T` : Text
- `Alt + I` : Image
- `Alt + V` : Video
- `Alt + 1` : Heading 1 (H1)
- `Alt + 2` : Heading 2 (H2)
- `Alt + 3` : Heading 3 (H3)
- `Alt + L` : Link
- `Alt + F` : Form
- `Alt + B` : Button
- `Alt + Shift + I` : Input
- `Alt + A` : Audio

</Tip>

## The Power of Containers: Grouping & Nesting

The most important element for creating clean, organized layouts is the **Container**. A container is a special element that acts as a box to hold and group other elements.

<Note>
  **Key Concept:** To create professional layouts, you should always place
  related elements inside a **Container**. For example, you would place a title,
  a paragraph, and a button together inside one container to create a "hero
  section".
</Note>

To nest an element, simply drag it from the Elements tab and drop it directly **on top of a container** in the canvas. You can also re-parent elements by dragging them within the **Layers** panel.

**Example Hierarchy in the Layers Panel:**

```text
- Container (Hero Section)
  - Text (Title: "Welcome to Saasio")
  - Text (Paragraph: "Build amazing apps...")
  - Button (Call to Action: "Get Started")
```
