Imagine you have a label on a box. If you change what's inside the box, you want the label to magically update too. That's exactly what **Data Binding** is. It’s the magic that links your UI elements (the label) to your data (what’s in the box).

When your data changes, your UI updates automatically. This is the key to creating an interactive application.

## How to Bind Data to an Element

You can make almost any element dynamic, from a piece of text to an image source. The process starts in the **Properties Panel**.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Select Your UI Element">
On the canvas, click on the Text element, Image, or any other element you want to make dynamic.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Find the Content Source">
  In the **Properties Panel** on the right, find the property that controls the
  element's content. This is often labeled **"Display"**. By default, it's set
  to "Static Text".
</Step>

<Step title="3. Change the Source">
  Click the dropdown and change the value from "Static" to the source you want
  to connect to. The most common choice is **"State Variable"**.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Select the Specific Data">
A new field will appear. Click it and choose the exact piece of data you want to display from the list.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Connecting a text element to a state variable."
    src="/images/state-ex.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />
</Frame>

The element is now "bound" to your data. Whenever that data changes, the element on the screen will change with it, automatically.

## The Three Main Data Sources

You can bind your UI elements to three primary sources of data.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="State Variable" icon="atom">
    **What it is:** The temporary memory of your page. 
    
    **When to use it:** This is your go-to source for most dynamic data, like loading indicators, user
    input from a form, or temporary results from an API call.
</Card>
<Card title="Repeating Group Item" icon="list">

    **What it is:** Data for a single item in a list you are displaying.

    **When to use it:** When your element is **inside a Repeating Group** (a list).
    This allows you to display a property from the specific item for that row,
    like showing the `name` of each `Product` in a product list.

</Card>
<Card title="Current User" icon="user">

**What it is:** The database record for the user who is currently logged
into your application.

**When to use it:** Anytime you want to display
personalized information, like the user's name, email, or profile picture.
