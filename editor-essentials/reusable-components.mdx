As you build your application, you'll often find yourself recreating the same set of UI elements. Imagine building a standardized user profile card with an image, a name, and a button. Instead of rebuilding this card on every page, you can create a single **Reusable Component**.

<Info>
  
**What is a Reusable Component?**

Think of it as your own custom-built LEGO
brick. You design and build it once, and then you can use that exact same
brick anywhere in your application. If you update the master brick, every copy
of it updates automatically.

## The Anatomy of a Reusable Component

Just like Functions, Reusable Components have their own internal logic and data, which makes them incredibly powerful.

**Think of these as the "customizable parts" of your LEGO brick.**

Props allow you to pass data _into_ your component from the outside. For a user
profile card, you would have props for the `userImage`, `userName`, and
`profileLink`, so each card can display different information while looking
the same.

**Think of these as the component's own private memory.**

Local States are
variables that exist only within the component. For example, a "Show More"
button inside your component could use a local `isExpanded` state to track
whether it's open or closed, without affecting anything outside the
component.

## How to Create a Reusable Component

Let's walk through creating a simple "User Profile Card" component.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to the Components Tab">
In the **Left Panel** of the Visual Editor, click on the **Components** tab.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Create a New Component">
  Click the **`+`** icon to create a new component. Give it a descriptive name,
  like `UserProfileCard`. This will open a dedicated canvas just for designing
  this component.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Define Props and Local States">
  With your new component open, you can define its inputs and internal memory in
  the properties panel. - **To add a Prop:** Define its name (e.g., `userName`)
  and its data type. - **To add a Local State:** Define its name and data type,
  just like a normal page state.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Design the Component's UI">
On the component's canvas, build its visual layout using standard elements. For our `UserProfileCard`, you would add an Image, a Text element, and a Button.

Now, **bind these elements to your props**. For example:

- Bind the **Image** element's `Source` to the `userImage` prop.
- Bind the **Text** element's `Content Source` to the `userName` prop.

</Step>
</Steps>

Your component is now a self-contained, customizable UI element.

<Warning>
  **Current Limitation:** At this time, you cannot place a reusable component
  inside itself (this is known as recursion).
</Warning>

## How to Use a Reusable Component

Once your component is created, using it is easy.

1.  Navigate to any page in your application.
2.  In the **Left Panel**, switch to the **Components** tab. You will see your newly created `UserProfileCard` in the list.
3.  **Drag and drop** your component onto the canvas just like any other UI element.
4.  With the component selected, the **Properties Panel** on the right will now show all the **Props** you defined. You can provide static or dynamic data for each prop to customize that specific instance of the component.
