Think of a [Zod](https://zod.dev/) Schema as a **rulebook for your data**. It's where you define exactly what a piece of information should look like. For example, a "Sign Up" schema could have these rules:

- An `email` field must be provided, and it must look like a real email address.
- A `password` field must be provided, and it must be at least 8 characters long.

By creating these rulebooks, you ensure that the data flowing through your application is always clean, correct, and secure. Saasio uses the powerful **Zod v4** library to make this possible without writing any code.

## Why Use Zod Schemas?

Zod Schemas are a versatile tool that you will use in many different parts of your application.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Powering Your Forms" icon="list">
    This is the most common use case. By linking a Form element to a Zod Schema,
    you automatically get data structure and validation. The form will know
    which fields are required, what type of data to expect, and will even show
    error messages for you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validating Data in Workflows" icon="check-double">
    Using the `Validate Data` action, you can check if any piece of data (e.g.,
    from an API call) matches your schema's rules before you try to save it to
    your database, ensuring data integrity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Structuring AI Outputs" icon="robot">
    When working with the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/), you can provide a Zod
    Schema to an AI model. This forces the AI to return its response in a
    perfectly structured JSON format that matches your rules, making AI outputs
    reliable and easy to work with.

## Creating a Zod Schema

Let's create a simple `SignUpSchema` to define the rules for a user registration form.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to the Zod Schemas Tab">
In the top navigation bar, click the **Data** tab, then select the **"Zod Schemas"** sub-tab.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Create a New Schema">
  Enter a name for your schema (e.g., `SignUpSchema`) and click **"Create"**.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Add Fields and Validation Rules">
With your new schema selected, click **"+ Add new field"**. For each field, you must define its rules in the properties panel.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Field Validation Rules

For each field in your schema, you can define:

- **Field Name:** The name of the property (e.g., `email`).
- **Data Type:** The type of data, such as `Text`, `Number`, or `Boolean`.
- **Validation Rules:** A set of rules to enforce, such as:
  - **Required:** Is this field mandatory?
  - **Minimum / Maximum Length:** For text fields.
  - **Email Format:** Checks if the text is a valid email address.
  - **Custom Error Message:** You can write your own error message that will be shown to the user if their input is invalid.

**Example: `SignUpSchema` Structure**

Here is how you would configure the fields for our `SignUpSchema`.

| Field Name | Data Type | Key Validation Rules        | Error Message Example                 |
| :--------- | :-------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `name`     | `Text`    | Required, Minimum length: 2 | "Name must be at least 2 characters." |
| `email`    | `Email`   | Required                    | "Please enter a valid email address." |
| `password` | `Text`    | Required, Minimum length: 8 | "Password must be 8+ characters."     |
