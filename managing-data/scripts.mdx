The **Scripts** tab is an advanced feature that allows you to inject custom JavaScript snippets directly into the `<head>` or `<body>` tags of your application's pages.

This feature is powerful but should be used with care, as poorly written or untrustworthy scripts can negatively affect your application's performance and security.

<Warning>
  **Primary Use Case:** This feature is intended for integrating trusted,
  third-party services that require you to paste a script tag into your site.
  Common examples include: - Analytics tools (like Hotjar or Mixpanel) - Live
  chat widgets (like Intercom or Crisp) - Advertising or marketing tracking
  pixels
