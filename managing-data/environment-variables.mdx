When you connect your Saasio application to external services like OpenAI or Stripe, you'll need to use **API keys** or **secret tokens**. These are like passwords for your application, and they must be kept private.

**Environment Variables** are the correct and secure way to store this sensitive information.

<Warning>
  **Never** paste your secret API keys directly into an action's configuration.
  Always use an Environment Variable instead to avoid a major security risk.
</Warning>

## What is an Environment Variable?

An Environment Variable is a key-value pair that is stored securely on the Saasio backend, not in the public-facing editor. You create a variable with a specific name (the key) and store your secret token as its value.

When your application runs a server-side action, Saasio uses these variables to authenticate with external services. This means your secrets are never exposed in your application's code or in the browser.

### Security and Encryption

<Note>
  To ensure the highest level of security, **all Environment Variable values are
  encrypted at rest**. This practice prevents any possibility of a leak and
  ensures that only your application's backend processes can access the
  sensitive data.
</Note>

## How to Create an Environment Variable

The creation process is the same for all types of secrets.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to the Environment Variables Tab">
In the top navigation bar, click the **Data** tab, then select the `Environment Variables` sub-tab.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Add a New Variable">
Click the `+ Add new variable` button. Two input fields will appear.

- **Name (Key):** Enter the name for your variable. **This is case-sensitive and must be exact.**
- **Value:** Carefully paste your secret API key or token into this field.

</Step>

<Step title="3. Save the Variable">
Click the `Save` button. Your variable is now securely stored.
</Step>
</Steps>

## How to Use Your Variables

How you use a variable depends on the action.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="For the AI SDK (Automatic)" icon="robot">
    **This is the easy way.** For integrated services like the AI SDK, Saasio automatically looks for specific, pre-defined variable names. **You do not need to reference the variable in the action itself.**

    Simply create the variable with the correct name, and Saasio handles the rest automatically.

    **Example:**
    - To use OpenAI, create a variable named exactly `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
    - Now, any "AI SDK" action that uses OpenAI will work automatically, without you needing to add the key anywhere else.

  </Card>
  <Card title="For Custom API Calls (Manual)" icon="paper-plane">
    **This is for everything else.** When you configure your own API endpoints in the "API Calls" tab, you need to tell Saasio where to use your secret.

    You do this by referencing the variable's name inside angle brackets `<...>` in the URL or Headers section.

    **Example:**
    - You create a variable named `MY_STRIPE_KEY`.
    - In your "Make an API call" action, you would set the `Authorization` header to `Bearer <MY_STRIPE_KEY>`.
    - Saasio will replace `<MY_STRIPE_KEY>` with your secret value when the call is made.
