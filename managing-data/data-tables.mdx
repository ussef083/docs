Every powerful application is built on a solid data structure. In Saasio, the foundation of your data is built in **Data Tables**.

Think of a Data Table as a spreadsheet or a database table. It's where you define the "shape" of the information you need to store. For example, a `Users` table would define that every user must have an `email` (Text), a `password` (Text), and a `lastLogin` (Date).

## What is a Data Table?

A Data Table is a blueprint for a specific type of data in your app. It's made up of **fields** (columns) where each field has a specific **data type**.

<Info>
  **Important:** The "Data Tables" tab is for defining the **structure** of your
  data. The actual data records (rows) are viewed and managed in the **"App
  Data"** tab.

## The Two Roles of a Data Table

In Saasio, Data Tables can serve two distinct but related purposes.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="For Storing Data" icon="database">
    This is the most common use. You create a table like `Products` or `Users`
    to be your actual database. You will use workflows to **create, read,
    update, and delete** rows in these tables.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Defining a 'Shape' (Pure Type)" icon="sitemap">
    This is a more advanced concept. You can create a table that **will not
    store any data itself**. Instead, its only job is to act as a **reusable
    blueprint** or a "shape" for your data. You can then reference this shape in
    your State variables or API responses to ensure your data is always
    structured correctly.
  </Card>

When you create a new table, you will see an option to define its role.

## Creating Your First Data Table

Let's create a simple `Products` table that will define the structure for products in an e-commerce store.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to the Data Tab">
In the top navigation bar of the editor, click on the **Data** tab. You will land on the **Data Tables** sub-tab by default.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Create a New Table">
  Enter a name for your new table in the input field (e.g., `Products`) and
  click the **"Create"** button. Your new table will appear in the list.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Add Fields (Columns) to Your Table">
With your `Products` table selected, you can now add fields to it. Click the **"+ Add new field"** button.

For each field, you need to define:

- **Field Name:** A descriptive name for the column (e.g., `productName`, `price`, `inStock`).
- **Data Type:** The type of data this field will hold.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Field Data Types

Choosing the correct data type is essential for a well-structured app. Here are some of the most common types:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Text" icon="font">
    For storing plain text, like names, descriptions, or emails.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Number" icon="calculator">
    For storing numerical values, like prices, quantities, or ratings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Boolean" icon="toggle-on">
    For storing a simple `true` or `false` value, like `inStock` or
    `isVerified`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Date" icon="calendar">
    For storing a specific date and time, like `createdAt` or `lastLogin`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relation to another Data Table" icon="link">
    This is a powerful feature that allows you to link tables together. For
    example, a `Products` table could have a `seller` field that is a relation
    to your `Users` table.
  </Card>
  <Card title="List of items" icon="list-ol">
    Check this box if a field should hold a list (array) of values instead of a
    single value. For example, a `productImages` field could be a `List` of
    `Images`.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example `Products` Table Structure:**

- `productName` (Text)
- `description` (Text)
- `price` (Number)
- `inStock` (Boolean)
- `images` (Image, List)
- `seller` (Relation to `Users` Table)
