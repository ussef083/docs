An **Option Set** is a predefined, reusable list of text choices. Think of it as a master list that you can refer to anywhere in your application.

For example, instead of manually typing "Free," "Basic," and "Pro" in every dropdown menu for a subscription plan, you can create a single "SubscriptionPlans" Option Set.

## Why Use Option Sets?

Using Option Sets is a best practice that saves time and prevents errors.

  <Card title="Ensure Consistency" icon="check-double">
    Prevent typos and variations by using the same master list everywhere. This
    ensures that a value is always "Pro" and never accidentally "pro" or
    "professional".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Make Easy Updates" icon="pencil">
    If you need to change or add an option (e.g., adding an "Enterprise" plan),
    you only have to do it in one place. Every UI element using that set will
    update automatically.

## How to Use an Option Set

Once created, you can use your Option Set in two primary places:

- **In Data Tables:** When creating a field in a Data Table, you can set its **Data Type** to be one of your Option Sets. This restricts the data for that field to only the choices you've defined, ensuring data integrity.
